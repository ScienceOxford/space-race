    <h1>Stop the Divide by Zero Error</h1>
    <br>
  </header>

  <div id="intro" class="left">
    <h3>Why do we get this error?</h3>
    <p>Most constellations can only be seen in the sky at certain times of the year.</p>
    <p>So if you choose to analyse the observations of a specific constellation, such as Orion, there won't be any data available for some of the months.</p>
    <p>To work out our average, we divided by the number of numbers. <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/dividing-by-zero.html" target="_blank">Dividing by zero doesn't work</a>, so Python will get confused and give you an error message!</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="code" class="left">
    <h3>Get the program to check before dividing!</h3>
    <p>We can fix the error by <strong>getting the program to check</strong> whether there are any data for a month before trying to work out the average of it.</p>
    <p>To do this, start an <strong>if statement</strong>, telling it to check if the length of the month is larger than zero.</p>
    <pre>if month in data.list > 0:</pre>
    <br>
    <p>Inside this if statement, you can put your original code to find the average.</p>
    <p>Add an <strong>else</strong> underneath, to tell it not to do the calculation if it can't do it - we can ask it to put a <code>0</code> in the list instead.</p>
    <pre>else:
  averages.append(0)</pre>
    <br>
    <p>Test this code and check for errors - remember that this should <strong>replace</strong> your current code to get the average, as we giving the program some extra instructions to do before it works out the average.</p>
    <p>Try it out by changing the <code>stars</code> variable to a single constellation - does it work out the averages without giving you an error message?</p>
    <br>

  <div id="code" class="left">
    <h3>The new code in full</h3>
    <p>If your code isn't working the way you expect, compare it to the example below.</p>
    <p>Check your <strong>indentation</strong> and look for spelling mistakes as well!</p>
    <pre>for month in data.list:
  if len(month) > 0:
    averages.append(sum(month)/len(month))
  else:
    averages.append(0)
print(averages)</pre>
