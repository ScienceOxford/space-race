    <p>During this workshop, you will create a quiz program in Python, then investigate data from the Globe at Night project.</p>
    <p>This page recaps what we discussed as a group</a>.</p>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>It's <a href="https://www.britishscienceweek.org/" target="_blank">British Science Week</a>! So we're going to do some <strong>scientific computing</strong> in this workshop.</p>
    <p>We will writing code using the Python programming language - this is often used by scientist to do their research!</p>
    <p>We will use Trinket as our <em>editor</em>. You can run and edit the code snippets directly from these instructions, or open each file seperately.</p>
    <p>Save your work by saving the <strong>link</strong> from the sharing menu, or by remixing the file into your own Trinket account.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Be patient when you code in Python - you will get error messages as you go along and this is completely normal! Whenever you make changes to your code, run the new program and make sure it works - we will discuss troubleshooting tips as we go along.</p>

    <h3>Beginning the Quiz</h3>
    <p>Run this code buy clicking the <strong>></strong> button on the top.</p>
    <iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python3/8e2fddee77" width="100%" height="356" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p><em>You can access this directly on the Trinket website by <a href="https://trinket.io/python3/8e2fddee77" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.</em></p>
    <p class=debugging><strong>Can you edit the code to show the answers instead of the questions?</strong></p>
    <br>
    <h5>So how does this work?</h5>
    <img src=".\images\starter-code-info.PNG" alt="Screenshot of code from editor above, described below" width="600px" height="auto">
    <ol type="A">
      <li>We tell the program to open the text file with the quiz inside.</li>
      <li>It looks at <strong>each line</strong> within that file, one at a time. This line of code is called a <strong>for loop</strong>.</li>
      <li>On the line, when it finds a dash <strong>-</strong> symbol, it splits the line in half - this is how we seperate the questions from the answers!</li>
      <li>It labels the first part <strong>question</strong>, and the second part <strong>answer</strong>, using <em>variables</em>.<br>Note that Python starts counting from <code>0</code> instead of from <code>1</code>, so <code>line[0]</code> is the first half of the line!</li>
      <li>It removes extra spaces from the end of each part.</li>
      <li>We tell it to <strong>print</strong> all the questions - this is why we see them in the <strong>Results</strong> part of the editor.</li>
      <li>Finally, because it doesn't need to look at the quiz any more, we tell it to close it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Did you notice the gap on the left before some of the lines?</strong> This is called indentation, and is how Python knows which lines of code are inside the for loop!</p>
    <br>
    <p class=debugging><strong>Can you add some of your own questions to the quiz?</strong><br>Check that the code still works if you print all the questions, and if you print all the answers!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Look in the <em>quiz.txt</em> file to see what the questions and answers look like.</li>
      <li>The dash <strong>-</strong> symbol before the answer is how the program knows to split up the line.</li>
    <ul>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="quiz-responses" class="left">
    <h3>Inputting Answers</h3>
    <p>Instead of putting all the questions on the screen at once, we can tell the program to print the first one, then wait for user input.</p>
    <p>Click on <strong>line 10</strong>, after <code>print(question)</code>, and add the following code:</p>
    <pre>response = input("What is the answer?")</pre>
    <br>
    <p class=debugging><strong>Test this code - what happens when you type in an answer?</strong></p>
    <p>If you get an error message, check your <strong>indentation</strong> - make sure the new code lines up with the line before it.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We can improve the quiz game by checking <strong>if the response given is the same as the answer in the file</strong>.</p>
    <p>Make a new line after line 10 and type the code below - make sure the new code lines up with with code above it.</p>
    <pre>if response == answer:
  print("Correct, well done!")</pre><br>
    <p>Test it out:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Does it work without error messages?</li>
      <li>What happens if you type the answer correctly?</li>
      <li>What happens if you type the answer incorrectly?</li>
      <li>Try changing the text in the brackets, then test it again!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you get an error:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Check your <strong>indentation</strong>.</li>
      <li>Check that you have <strong>two equals signs <code>==</code></strong> between response and answer - this means 'is it equal to?'</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>You can expand this code further by getting something different to happen if the answer is not correct.</p>
    <pre>else:
  print(" ")</pre><br>
    <p>Try adding this to your code - where should you put it? What do you want to put in the brackets?</p>
    <p class=debugging><strong>Remember to keep testing your code to check for errors!</strong></p>
