    <h1>Add Extra Data to the Same Graph</h1>
    <br>
  </header>

  <div id="intro" class="left">
    <h3>What do you want to investigate?</h3>
    <p>If you want to compare two different sets of data, for example 2020 vs 2017, you could put two lines next to each other on your graph.</p>
    <p>This involves lots of copy-and-pasting of your code, so can get confusing very fast! Be patient and look at your code carefully to make sure you find the correct parts.</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="copy" class="left">
    <h3>Which parts of the code create the graph?</h3>
    <p>The first step is identifying which bits of your code will need repeating - which parts look at the data and create the graph?</p>
    <pre>year = "2020.txt"
stars = "all"
location = "all"
data.globeData(year, stars, location)
averages = []
for month in data.list:
  averages.append(sum(month)/len(month))
print(averages)
plt.plot(months, averages, color="red")</pre>
    <br>
    <p>Your code will look something like the example above.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You choose your variables.</li>
      <li>You access the data.</li>
      <li>You make a list to fill with the averages of this chosen data - <strong>this is what you are plotting on your graph</strong>.</li>
      <li>You print the averages (we don't actually need this line any more, so you could delete it!)</li>
      <li>Lastly, you plot this line on your graph, in the colour red.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>All of this information is important, so copy all of these lines, and past them underneath - above any other code you have added at the end of your program!</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="edit" class="left">
    <h3>Editing your pasted code</h3>
    <p>Now you can decide what you want your second line to show, and make a few changes to the second set of code.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Change your variables, e.g. which year you want to look at.</li>
      <li>Change the name of the averages list - <strong>we don't want the program to rewrite the averages data from before, because we still want that on the graph as well!</strong> - call it e.g. <code>averages2</code>.</li>
      <li>Inside your for loop, change <code>averages</code> to <code>averages2</code>.</li>
      <li>Change the last line, which plots the line - change <code>averages</code> to <code>averages2</code>, and change the colour.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class=debugging>This can be very confusing, as all of the code looks very similar. Take it slowly, keep checking for errors, and don't panic - we can help you if you get stuck!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Look at this example, choosing data from 2020 in red and 2017 in blue:</p>
    <pre>year = "2020.txt"
stars = "all"
location = "all"
data.globeData(year, stars, location)
averages = []
for month in data.list:
  averages.append(sum(month)/len(month))
plt.plot(months, averages, color="red")

year = "2017.txt"
stars = "all"
location = "all"
data.globeData(year, stars, location)
averages2017 = []
for month in data.list:
  averages2017.append(sum(month)/len(month))
plt.plot(months, averages2017, color="blue")

plt.show()</pre>
  <br>
  </div>

  <div id="debugging" class="left">
    <h3>Debugging tips</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Only add one new line at once! It's really difficult to debug lots of things at the same time, so get two lines working before adding a third.</li>
      <li>Check that you renamed <code>averages</code> in all <strong>three</strong> places.</li>
      <li>Check that each line is a different colour, so you can tell them apart.</li>
      <li>Make sure <code>plt.show()</code> is right at the very end.</li>
    </ul>
